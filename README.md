# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Mini Projects

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of three mini projects focusing on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python. Each project highlights a different aspect of data analysis, covering statistical calculations, demographic data insights, and medical data visualization. I created these projects by following the Data Analysis course by freecodecamp

## Projects

### 1. Mean Variance Standard Deviation Calculator
- **Description**: A Python-based calculator that computes the mean, variance, and standard deviation of a 3x3 matrix.
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates mean, variance, and standard deviation along rows, columns, and the entire matrix.
  - Utilizes NumPy for efficient matrix operations.

### 2. Demographic Data Analyzer
- **Description**: Analyzes demographic data from a CSV file to provide insights into various social statistics.
- **Key Features**:
  - Calculates statistics like race counts, average age, education levels, and working hours.
  - Identifies income patterns based on education and occupation.
  - Uses Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

### 3. Medical Data Visualizer
- **Description**: Visualizes medical data from a CSV file to analyze patient health trends.
- **Key Features**:
  - Normalizes data for cholesterol and glucose levels.
  - Creates categorical plots and heatmaps to visualize correlations.
  - Employs Seaborn and Matplotlib for plotting.

## Features
- Hands-on EDA projects showcasing data manipulation, statistical analysis, and visualization.
- Clean and modular code with clear documentation.
- Insightful visualizations and statistical summaries.

## Installation & Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/EDA-mini-projects.git](https://github.com/Aabhas2/EDA-Mini-Projects.git)
   cd EDA-mini-projects
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
- Open the Jupyter Notebook:
  ```bash
  jupyter notebook EDA_projects.ipynb
  ```
- Run the notebook cells to execute each project.

## Examples
- **Mean Variance Calculator Output:**
  ```python
  {
    'mean': [3.0, 4.0, 5.0, 4.0],
    'variance': [2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
    'standard deviation': [1.41, 1.41, 1.41, 1.41]
  }
  ```

- **Demographic Data Insights:**
  - Average age of men: 39.58
  - Percentage with Bachelor's degrees: 16.4%
  - Percentage of high earners: 24.5%

- **Medical Data Visualizations:**
  - Categorical plots showing patient distributions.
  - Heatmaps highlighting feature correlations.
